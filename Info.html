Set up a socket for a UDP server program that works like so:

The client will send a line of text to the server.
The server will receive the data and convert each character to uppercase.
The server will send the uppercase characters to the client.
The client will receive and display them on its screen.

Sockets are software endpoints that processes write and read data from.
They are bound to an IP address and a port.
The sending process attaches the IP address and port number of the receiving application.
The IP address and port number of the sending process are also attached to the packets as headers,
but thatâ€™s not done manually in the code of the application itself.
Networking libraries are provided with nearly all programming languages and they take responsibility for lots of plumbing.
